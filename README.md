## ‚ú® How It Works

Colmoji is a lightweight userscript that seamlessly enhances your typing experience across the web.

-   **Intuitive Trigger:** It activates when you type a colon (`:`), just like on platforms like Discord or Slack.
-   **Intelligent Suggestions:** Instantly see your most recently used emojis, or start typing to search through thousands of options in real-time.
-   **Smart Theming:** The menu automatically detects and adapts to both light and dark website themes.
-   **Stable & Draggable:** The UI intelligently anchors itself to the text box you're using and can be dragged anywhere on the screen.
-   **Fast & Efficient:** Emoji data is fetched once from a reliable CDN and then cached locally in your browser for instant performance every time.

## üöÄ Setup & Installation

Getting started is simple and takes less than a minute.

#### 1. Install a Userscript Manager
First, you'll need a browser extension to run Colmoji. The most popular choices are:
-   [**Tampermonkey**](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (Recommended for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
-   [**Violentmonkey**](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) (A popular open-source alternative)

#### 2. Install Colmoji
With your userscript manager installed, just click the link below:

### ‚û°Ô∏è [**Click Here to Install Colmoji**](https://github.com/loriwasstolen/colmoji/raw/main/colmoji.user.js)

A new tab will open in your userscript manager. Click the **"Install"** button, and you're all set! Colmoji will even update itself automatically whenever a new version is released.

## ‚å®Ô∏è How to Use It

Using Colmoji is designed to be completely effortless.

-   **Open:** Type a colon (`:`) in any text area to show recent emojis.
-   **Search:** Type a search term after the colon, like `:smile` or `:cat`.
-   **Navigate:** Use the `‚Üë` and `‚Üì` arrow keys to highlight a suggestion.
-   **Select:** Press `Enter` or `Tab` to insert the highlighted emoji.
-   **Close:** Press `Escape` or simply click anywhere else on the page.
-   **Move:** Click and drag the menu wherever you'd like it to be.
