## How It Works

Colmoji is a lightweight userscript that intelligently enhances your typing experience.

-   It actively listens for you to type a colon (`:`) in any text box.
-   A clean, modern UI appears, showing your recently used emojis or live search results.
-   Emoji data is fetched once from a fast, reliable CDN and then cached in your browser for instant performance.
-   The menu is smart‚Äîit automatically adapts to light or dark themes, anchors itself to your text box, and can be dragged anywhere on the screen.

## üöÄ Setup & Installation

Getting started is simple. You'll be running in under a minute.

1.  **Install a Userscript Manager**
    You need an extension to run Colmoji. The most popular choices are:

    -   [**Violentmonkey**](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) (A popular open-source alternative)
